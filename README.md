# Object Detection

Package: OpenCV
Model: MobileNet-SSD v3 

Used the pretrained model (trained on COCO dataset) of MobileNet-SSD v3 available on https://github.com/opencv/opencv/wiki/TensorFlow-Object-Detection-API

Played with different images to test the model performance for detecting the objects in it.
